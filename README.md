# Calidad CAR

Calidad CAR is a tool for mathematical modelling of water quality in rivers. This tool assumes user all ready has the results of water movement modelling with the Hec-Ras modelling system. Calidad CAR does not require additional modules other than python modules already installed within QGIS.

To setup a simulation you will need to load the shape file for the main river chanel and also for sections where quality measurements were taken.  The water quality model uses implicit and explicit algorithms  and is time variant and allows non constant space step (dx).  Now is in its development stage and will be ready this year. For further information contact developers.
